## Wallety
`NODE VERSION 16.13.2`
`React Router v6`

**I’m excited to share my latest project, Wallety, a financial management platform designed to help users manage their finances efficiently and intuitively. Wallety not only provides comprehensive support for tracking expenses and bills, but it also offers the functionality to create groups of friends, making it easier to organize shared expenses during trips.**

**With an interface built in React.js, I aim to provide a smooth and responsive user experience. The backend is developed in Node.js, ensuring robust and scalable performance. For data storage and management, I’m utilizing AWS services, which offer security and reliability. Wallety will be hosted and tested on Vercel, guaranteeing fast and efficient deployment.**

**This project represents a valuable opportunity to strengthen my knowledge and skills in the technologies I enjoy working with, while also being an important step in building solutions that can make a real difference in people's lives. I’m excited to continue developing Wallety and watch how it evolves!**
